Q. Is ordering online secure?
A. Yes. We take the utmost care with the information that you provide us when placing an order on our website (or through any other means).
    The server that hosts our store encrypts the transmission of all credit card and personal customer information using the Internet-standard
    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. During the encryption process, information is scrambled into small bits of code that cannot
    be read as they travel to us over the Internet. Once we receive the encrypted information, we use a private, key to decode it.

    All of the information you provide during the ordering process is restricted to our staff, and we make sure that all of our
    employees up-to-date on our security and privacy policies.  If you have further questions about the security of ordering online
    from Laura Janelle, please feel free to e-mail us at info@laurajanelle.com.
